# Stable Diffusion WebUI Docker

Run Stable Diffusion on your machine with a nice UI without any hassle!

This repository provides the [WebUI](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion-webui) as docker for easy setup and deployment. Please note that this repo delivers all cutting-edge unstable changes from the WebUI, so expect some bugs.

### Features

- Interactive UI with many features, and more on the way!
- Support for 6GB GPU cards.
- GFPGAN for face reconstruction, RealESRGAN for super-sampling.
- [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/hlky/sd-enable-textual-inversion)
- many more!

## Setup

make sure you have docker installed and up to date. Download this repo and run:

```
docker compose build
```

you can let it build in the background while you download the different models

- [Stable Diffusion v1.4 (4GB)](https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/aai-blog-files/o/sd-v1-4.ckpt?alt=media), rename to `model.ckpt`
- (Optional) [GFPGANv1.3.pth (333MB)](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth).
- (Optional) [RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth (64MB)](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth) and [RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth (18MB)](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.2.4/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth).

Put all of the downloaded files in the `models` folder, it should look something like this:

```
models/
├── GFPGANv1.3.pth
├── RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth
├── RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth
└── model.ckpt
```

## Run

After the build is done, you can run the app with:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Will start the app on http://localhost:7860/

Note: the first start will take sometime as some other models will be downloaded, these will be cached in the `cache` folder, so next runs are faster.

## Config

in the `docker-compose.yml` you can change the `CLI_ARGS` variable, which contains the arguments that will be passed to the WebUI. By default: `--extra-models-cpu --optimized-turbo` are given, which allow you to use this model on a 6GB GPU. However, some features might not be available in the mode.

[You can find the full list of arguments here](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion/blob/c5b2c86f1479dec75b0e92dd37f9357a68594bda/scripts/webui.py)

## FAQ

- To enable [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/hlky/sd-enable-textual-inversion) remove `--optimize` and `--optimize-turbo` flags and add `--no-half`, [more info here](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker/issues/6).
- If [output is a always green imagee](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker/issues/9), use `--precision full --no-half`.
