# Stable Diffusion WebUI Docker

Run Stable Diffusion on your machine with a nice UI without any hassle!

This repository provides the [WebUI](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion-webui) as a docker image for easy setup and deployment.

Now with experimental support for 2 other forks:

- [AUTOMATIC1111](./AUTOMATIC1111/) (Stable, very few bugs!)
- [lstein](./lstein/)

NOTE: big update coming up!

## Features

- Interactive UI with many features, and more on the way!
- Support for 6GB GPU cards.
- GFPGAN for face reconstruction, RealESRGAN for super-sampling.
- Experimental:
  - Latent Diffusion Super Resolution
  - GoBig
  - GoLatent
- many more!

## Setup

Make sure you have an **up to date** version of docker installed. Download this repo and run:

```
docker compose build
```

you can let it build in the background while you download the different models

- [Stable Diffusion v1.4 (4GB)](https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/aai-blog-files/o/sd-v1-4.ckpt?alt=media), rename to `model.ckpt`
- (Optional) [GFPGANv1.3.pth (333MB)](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth).
- (Optional) [RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth (64MB)](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.1.0/RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth) and [RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth (18MB)](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.2.4/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth).
- (Optional) [LDSR (2GB)](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/578df07c8fc04ffbadf3/?dl=1) and [its configuration](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/31a76b13ea27482981b4/?dl=1), rename to `LDSR.ckpt` and `LDSR.yaml` respectively.
<!-- - (Optional) [RealESRGAN_x2plus.pth (64MB)](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.1/RealESRGAN_x2plus.pth)
- TODO: (I still need to find the RealESRGAN_x2plus_6b.pth) -->

Put all of the downloaded files in the `models` folder, it should look something like this:

```
models/
├── model.ckpt
├── GFPGANv1.3.pth
├── RealESRGAN_x4plus.pth
├── RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth
├── LDSR.ckpt
└── LDSR.yaml
```

## Run

After the build is done, you can run the app with:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Will start the app on http://localhost:7860/

Note: the first start will take sometime as some other models will be downloaded, these will be cached in the `cache` folder, so next runs are faster.

### FAQ

You can find fixes to common issues [in the wiki page.](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker/wiki/FAQ)

## Config

in the `docker-compose.yml` you can change the `CLI_ARGS` variable, which contains the arguments that will be passed to the WebUI. By default: `--extra-models-cpu --optimized-turbo` are given, which allow you to use this model on a 6GB GPU. However, some features might not be available in the mode. [You can find the full list of arguments here.](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/2b1ac8daf7ea82c6c56eabab7e80ec1c33106a98/scripts/webui.py)

You can set the `WEBUI_SHA` to [any SHA from the main repo](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion/commits/main), this will build the container against that commit. Use at your own risk.
